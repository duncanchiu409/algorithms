In python, array and list are different.

Array vs List in Python ?
In default, Python uses Lists as default data structure inside [].
However, Array needs to be imported and declared in Python.

Conclusion: Default [] is List == Vector in c++, Array needs import and delcaration.

Vector in C++ vs Python List ?
In python, List is not totally Vector in c++.
List allows Different Data Type stored inside, meanwhile Vector C++ can be one data type only.

Powerful Man, Python the king of Language :)

Python Random Indexing ? What is it ?
array=[10,3,7,5]
print(array[:]) #print 10
print(array[1:3]) #print index from 1 to 2

What is random access ?

Why there is negative index ?
negative is a unique indexing way of python.
It allows you to access last element without knowing the size of array.
-1 the last element, -2 second last element, and so on.

Why no list in Python ?
List takes a lot of memory as they are dynamic array.
Each pointer (Or named: References) is taking 8 bytes in size, not counting dynamic memory size.

Solution: Use NumPy library to import proper array.
