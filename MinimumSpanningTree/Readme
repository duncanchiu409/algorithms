Minimum Spanning Tree

What is a spanning tree ?
Spanning Tree is a tree and path that connects all vertices in the connected graph G with no cycle.

How much spanning tree in a graph G ?
G = { V , E } V = vertices, E = edges.
Possible Combinations is E C V-1  -  no.of.cycles  C stands for combinations.

What is a cycle in graph ?
A cycle is a sub-path that form acyclic graph. Where a vertex is accessed second time in the path.

What is the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) ?
MST is the spanning tree that have the smallest total weight.

Easy Approach:
Find all combinations' total weight and compare.
Return the smallest weight one.

Algorithms Applies:
Kruskal's Algorithm, Prim's Algorithm, Boruvka's Algorithm

Is there example of algorithm's application ?
Network Company uses it a lot.
Its been used for graphing the shortest pipes and wires to connect users.
The weight/cost of an edge will be the cost building pipes and wires respected with length.
